## ü§ñ What is a Machine Learning Algorithm?

A **machine learning algorithm** is a method or set of rules the computer uses to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions.

## üß† Categories of ML Algorithms

### 1. **Supervised Learning**
You train the model with **labeled data** (you know the answers).

#### Common algorithms:
| Algorithm                 | Used For         | Example Use Case |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Linear Regression**     | Regression       | Predict house prices |
| **Logistic Regression**   | Classification   | Spam or not spam |
| **Decision Tree**         | Both             | Loan approval |
| **Random Forest**         | Both             | Predict diabetes |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | Classification | Image recognition |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**    | Both             | Recommender systems |
| **Gradient Boosting (e.g. XGBoost, LightGBM)** | Both | Tabular data competition models |

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
You train the model with **unlabeled data** (no right answers given).

#### Common algorithms:
| Algorithm          | Used For     | Example Use Case     |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **K-Means Clustering** | Clustering   | Group customers by behavior |
| **Hierarchical Clustering** | Clustering | Market segmentation |
| **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** | Dimensionality reduction | Visualizing high-dimensional data |
| **t-SNE / UMAP**   | Visualization | Understanding large datasets |

---

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning**
The model learns by **trial and error**, receiving rewards or penalties.

| Algorithm            | Used For                | Example Use Case        |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Q-Learning**        | Decision-making         | Game AI                 |
| **Deep Q Networks (DQN)** | Complex environments     | Self-driving cars       |
| **Policy Gradient Methods** | Optimizing behavior       | Robotics, simulations   |

## üßÆ Quick Overview of Some Algorithms

### ‚úÖ Linear Regression
- Predicts a continuous number.
- Formula: `y = mx + b`

### ‚úÖ Logistic Regression
- Predicts categories (e.g., yes/no).
- Outputs probabilities.

### ‚úÖ Decision Tree
- Splits data into branches (like a flowchart).
- Easy to understand.

### ‚úÖ Random Forest
- Collection of many decision trees.
- More accurate and stable.

### ‚úÖ KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- Looks at the ‚Äúk‚Äù closest examples to make a prediction.
- Simple and effective.

### ‚úÖ SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Finds the best line (or hyperplane) that separates classes.

### ‚úÖ K-Means Clustering
- Groups similar data points together without knowing labels.
